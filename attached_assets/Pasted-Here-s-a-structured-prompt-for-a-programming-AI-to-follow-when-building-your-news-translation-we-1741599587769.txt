Hereâ€™s a structured prompt for a **programming AI** to follow when building your news translation website:  

---

**### Prompt for AI Developer:**  

**Project:** Automated News Translation Website for Secondary School Students  

**Objective:**  
Develop a **GitHub Pages** website using **Jekyll** that fetches news articles from multiple sources, translates them into French, and categorizes them for KS3 and GCSE students. The site should update automatically using **GitHub Actions**.  

---

### **1. Website Structure (Jekyll)**
- Use **Jekyll** to generate a static news website.  
- The site should have:  
  - A **homepage** displaying the latest articles.  
  - Two sections: **KS3 (simplified articles)** and **GCSE (complex articles)**.  
  - Each article should have a **title, translated summary, and a link to the original article**.  

---

### **2. News Fetching & Translation**
- Fetch articles from **multiple RSS feeds**:  
  - BBC News, The Guardian, The New York Times, etc.  
- Use **Google Translate API** to translate **titles and summaries** into French.  
- **Remove duplicates** by checking article titles across all sources.  

---

### **3. Categorization (KS3 vs GCSE)**
- KS3 articles should be **shorter & simplified** (e.g., max 100 words).  
- GCSE articles can be **longer and more complex** (up to 250 words).  
- Categorization can be based on **word count** or **NLP readability scoring**.  

---

### **4. Automation (GitHub Actions)**
- Set up a **GitHub Action** to run a Python script daily:  
  - Fetch latest news.  
  - Translate it into French.  
  - Save as **Markdown posts in `_posts/`** for Jekyll.  
  - Commit & push changes to update the site.  

---

### **5. UI/UX Design**
- Use a **modern, clean UI** with a blue & white theme.  
- Navigation bar with **Home, KS3, GCSE** links.  
- Cards for articles with **titles, summaries, and â€˜Read Moreâ€™ buttons**.  

---

### **6. Tech Stack**
âœ… **GitHub Pages + Jekyll** (Static site)  
âœ… **Python (feedparser, googletrans)** (News fetching & translation)  
âœ… **GitHub Actions** (Automation)  
âœ… **Google Translate API** (Translation)  

---

### **Expected Output**
- A **fully automated website** that updates daily with translated news.  
- Clean **Jekyll-generated pages** categorized for KS3 & GCSE.  
- **No duplicate articles** from multiple news sources.  
- **Fast performance** with a mobile-friendly layout.

Would you like me to add **specific coding constraints** (e.g., must use YAML config files, Bootstrap for styling, etc.)? ðŸš€
